            <p>My relationship with this dish begins at a very early age where the whole family would go to eat this delicious food. Years have passed and it is still my favorite dish, perhaps for the same fact that it reminds me of what everything was like when I was a child. Or maybe its flavor and that despite being a very well-known dish in Ecuador, each person, place or restaurant prepares it in a different way and makes it unique in their own way, so you can try it again and again and it will always have a different flavor. familiar but not the same. It is a dish that I miss and although I like to cook I have never done it because I think that if I learn it, I will end up doing it very often and maybe it will take away from the magic that I find in it. For me it is a dish that reminds me of my family, of sharing time together and how delicious the food of my country is.</p>
